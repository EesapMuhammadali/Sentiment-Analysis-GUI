# Sentiment Analysis GUI

## Project Overview
This project is a GUI-based Sentiment Analysis tool that classifies text input into positive or negative. It leverages trained machine learning models for logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization, packaged with a desktop graphical user interface.

## Features
- User-friendly GUI for easy input of text data.
- Real-time sentiment classification.
- Uses pre-trained machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- Supports loading and saving of model files.
- Built with Python (Jupyter Notebook for model training) and GUI developed in Visual Studio Code.

## Files in Repository
- `sentiment_gui.exe` - Executable for the GUI application (handled via Git LFS).
- `best_model_logistic_regression.pkl` - Serialized logistic regression model file.
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` - Serialized TF-IDF vectorizer file.
- `.gitattributes` - Git LFS configuration file.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Git LFS is installed to handle large files properly.
3. Run the GUI executable or launch the Python scripts for training/updating models.
4. Input text and receive sentiment analysis results instantly.

## Development
- Model training done in Jupyter Notebook.
- GUI developed and maintained in Visual Studio Code.
- Contributions are welcome through pull requests.
